ChatGPT’s take on my title
Whether you’re looking for your dream home, are a budding investor looking to make money moves, or are a seasoned professional who needs a little structure when scouting a deal, this post will help you identify your goals, set up some guardrails, and prioritize your wish list.
Over the past couple of months, I’ve been learning about a domain I only have limited experience in: real estate investing. I’ve been keeping myself busy reading blog posts and forums and watching a stupid amount of YouTube videos while reflecting on mistakes I’ve made in my past purchases. Before I forget everything, I’ve decided to create a framework for myself so that I won’t just wing it next time.
# The Pitfalls of Emotional Investment in Real Estate
Have you ever fallen in love with a property because ‌it was beautifully staged or had an eye-catching landscape, only to realize later that it didn’t align with your investment goals? This is a common pitfall for both new and experienced investors, and it can lead to costly mistakes. I know from personal experience that a beautiful view and a very competitive market can sidetrack anyone from noticing red flags. It got me to overlook a pretty funky and costly do-it-yourself remodel.
# The Importance of a Clear Plan
To avoid this, it’s essential to have a clear plan before you begin touring properties, regardless of the market. By outlining your investment goals, risk tolerance, and budget, you avoid getting caught up in the moment and making decisions you regret later. Your purchasing plan will help you stay focused on the long term and ensure that your investments align with your overall financial strategy. And let’s be real: we all want less stress and higher ROI on our real estate investments, and by focusing on your clearly defined plan, you’ll be able to make faster, smarter decisions.
**Tip:**Make sure to include a list of criteria that you will use to evaluate potential properties while on the go.
# 1. Defining Your Goals
**Why It’s Important**: Having defined goals will keep you focused, so you don’t get sidetracked by other opportunities that might be attractive but don’t fit your current needs.
Ask yourself what your end game is and work backwards from there. Maybe you want to quit your 9–5, so cash flow is more important to you, while other investors might be focused on building equity long-term to build wealth in an appreciating asset. Possibly, you’re renting in a low-vacancy rental market and want to lower your monthly costs, where having a mortgage might be a lower monthly payment than rent.
Here is a quick breakdown of common goals for buying real estate:
**Long-Term Financial Goal:**Do you want appreciation, cash flow, or both?
* **Cash Flow**: Generate rental income in low-vacancy rental markets.
* **Appreciation**: Grow your assets with increased property value over time.
* **Hybrid Strategy**: Balancing immediate income with long-term value.
* **Just give me a place to live:**Mortgage vs renting can sometimes be cheaper, but most buyers in this bucket consider a house an investment.
**Target Return Goal:**For real estate investors, this could mean knowing how much return on investment (ROI) you expect (e.g., rental income, flip potential, or resale value).
Defining the return you aim for helps you set realistic expectations on a property. If your goal is cash flow from a multi-family property so you can retire in 10 years, you might focus on the estimated net income per unit of $300 and other metrics you care about. We won’t define all the metrics, but you’ll want to understand the possible ways you can estimate and track your target returns. The point of this post is to provide a structure for making better real estate decisions, and I’ll leave the metrics glossary to the experts.
# 2. Guardrails
**Why It’s Important**: While most investors focus on the obviousguardrails such as purchase price or school zones, it’s important to also think about what could later impact your ROI, such as potential costs of repairs or upgrades. So maybe you will want to set up guardrails filtering out properties older than 1990 or at least figure these costs into your metrics covered in the goals section. This will help you ensure that you don’t overextend yourself financially and get carried away by that alarmingly cheap mid-century apartment complex that looks like it just needs a coat of paint to bring it to life.
## Set Up Guardrails to Avoid Emotional Decisions
* **Budget**: Define a maximum investment budget that includes purchase price, renovation costs, and reserves.
* **Geographic Boundaries**: Identify acceptable neighborhoods or locations based on your research (consider school zones, walkability, crime rates, etc.).
* **Non-Negotiables (No-Gos)**: List features that are immediate deal-breakers (e.g., flood zone locations, unpermitted work, certain property ages).
Tip: If it’s not a confident yes, then it should be a confident no. Don’t talk yourself into a property that isn’t a good fit. Trust your instincts, the data, and most importantly, your plan.
# **3. Prioritization**
**Why It’s Important**: Unfortunately, we are not all independently wealthy (yet), so we do have to make tradeoffs with our real estate purchases. While this is just one of many prioritization frameworks, it’s easy to remember. It’s called the ​​MoSCoW method and is often used in product management to help prioritize features or functionality within a feature.
* **Must-Haves**: Essential features that are non-negotiable for the investment (e.g., a minimum number of bedrooms, finished basement for Airbnb use).
* **Should-Haves**: Important features that strongly influence choice but aren’t deal-breakers (e.g., proximity to public transport, a second bathroom).
* **Could-Haves**: These are features that are desirable but don’t significantly impact the property’s value or usability (e.g., a finished basement or an updated kitchen).
* **Won’t Haves**: Clearly defined red flags that immediately eliminate a property (e.g., extensive repairs needed, located on a high-traffic street).
**Tip**: Use your list to filter when looking at properties online, and keep them on your phone to revisit them before any property tour. After looking at ten properties in one weekend, you&#x27;d be surprised what you forget.
# “Slow is Smooth, and Smooth is Fast”
As the Navy SEAL mantra goes, “slow is smooth, and smooth is fast”. In real estate, clearly defining your goals and setting limits before viewing properties will result in quicker and more confident decision-making. You can secure lower-risk deals and achieve your investment objectives faster by getting your priorities straight.
## The Advantages of Establishing and Adhering to a Plan:
* **Faster Decisions**: Eliminate hesitation with clear, early planning.
* **Staying Within Budget**: Avoid financial overextension in competitive markets.
* **Reduced Emotional Attachment**: Stay objective and avoid impulsive purchases.
* **Long-Term Success**: Align purchases with broader investment strategies.# Take Action
Remember, I’m still learning this stuff, too, so take my recommendations with a grain of salt. But before you start looking for your first or next property, you should define your goals, guardrails, and prioritization criteria. Whether buying a dream home or investing for cash flow or appreciation, this preparation will set you up for smarter decisions and less stress down the road.
