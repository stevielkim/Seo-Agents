Short-term rental metrics
Here I am again, folks, talking about CrewAI. But this week, I’ll share some details about the hurdles I encountered. Yes, that’s right, the hurdles I ran into —I never was much of an athlete. In[my last post](https://medium.com/@StevieLKim/crewai-and-me-part-1-2fa579bcb07c), I covered the basic settings and some best practices for getting started with CrewAI. In this post, I’ll share my simple research and report configurations for trends and predictions in the short-term rental market. In true “me” fashion, I’ll also expose some of the challenges I encountered and the lessons I learned along the way. Let’s dive in.
# Short-term Rentals: Market Trends and Forecast
When I started tinkering around with CrewAI, I didn’t have a specific project in mind. I just wanted to put some of my high-level conceptual knowledge about agentic workflows to practical use. But, after I went through their[Quickstart](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart)guide that shows you how to build a report based on their default topic: “AI Agents,” I was inspired to wire up some of my own minions to research and report on the short-term rental forecast for 2025, complete with matplotlib charts.
# Reflection (mine, not the agents):
While everything about using CrewAI is easy, it’s challenging to get the right mix of explicit directives while allowing the agents to make their own decisions. The point, at least to me, is not to automate what I normally do but to nudge the agents to perform tasks in a way that uncovers more information and insights than I could on my own.
To start out, I created a 1:1 relationship between 3 agents and 3 tasks, mostly because I didn’t know what I was doing. Turns out this isn’t the most effective or efficient way to design an agentic workflow because it’s slower and more prone to errors due to increased complexity.
**Outline of my original workflow:**
**Research Agent:**Gathers data on short-term real estate trends and identifies opportunities in emerging markets.
* **Task Output:**list with 10 bullet points of relevant information
* **Configuration:
**- delegation=True
- tools=[file\_writer\_tool, file\_read\_tool,serper\_tool]
**Chart Agent:**Generates visualizations based on raw data and reports.
* **Task Output:**Matplotlib charts
* **Configuration:
-**tools=[file\_writer\_tool, file\_read\_tool]
- allow\_code\_execution=True
**Reporting Agent**: Synthesizes data into a markdown report containing actionable insights for investors.
* **Task Output:**Comprehensive report in markdown
* **Configuration:
**- delegation=True
- tools=[file\_writer\_tool, file\_read\_tool]

As I didn’t think to use version control until later, I don’t have the exact settings for my initial setup. However, I admit there was a chaotic mess of verbose task descriptions with multiple iterations before I got my desired result. While the markdown reports were created, the content was too brief to be called a “robust report.” But I had bigger issues.
## Charts: Sometimes You See Them, Sometimes You Don’t
One of the first ongoing issues I encountered was that sometimes the charts would be created, while at other times they weren’t. And when they were, they were in multiple directories.
For the problem of the occasional missing charts, I extended the retries from the default “2” to “5” for my Research Agent, who wrote the files necessary for the Reporting Agent, since I thought maybe the Reporting Agent was trying to create the reports too soon. This provided consistency.
```
max\_retry\_limit=5
```
Some of the charts created weren’t exactly helpful. ‌Sometimes the charts would be labeled*City A*, City B, etc. while others had the actual city names.
![]()
The offending charts with simulated data
I probably should have explicitly told my agents that when performing a task, if they can’t find relevant data, don’t make it up.
So, I added to my Research Task’s description:
*If you cannot find any data from your online searches, don’t create fake data, but instead, retry your search.*
This fixed the issue, and I got useful charts, but they were still in the wrong directory.
![]()
To get the charts and the files in the same directory, I explicitly defined the required file name and directory using the Task attribute*output\_file,*which caused unexpected behavior. Sometimes, the agents saved the chart files to the parent directory, sometimes to the directory None, and sometimes to a directory called*Data*.
Troubleshooting I looked into the different agent and task settings. I already had delegation=True, which should have ensured that tasks have the necessary context to generate and incorporate charts into the report.
I then explored using the context attribute for tasks to specify which outputs should serve as inputs for subsequent tasks. That didn’t work and only caused more inconsistencies. So, I stopped adding stuff and thought about how I had designed the agent-to-task relationship.
On top of the strange chart behavior, the workflow was slower than I expected it to be, so I removed the Chart Agent and assigned the Chart Task to the Reporting Agent.
This provided a 1:1 and 1:2 relationship between agents and tasks:
![]()
This had a couple of beneficial side effects. The charts were created faster (expected), but unexpectedly, the charts now appeared in the same directory that the markdown files were written to!
Basically, it seems that even though I had delegation=True, and the context attribute set to the appropriate tasks, there was still missing context between the original 3 agents. Having the Reporting Agent deliver both the charts and the report while relying only on the Research Task’s output solved the problem.
*I asked ChatGPT about my observations:*
“Studies indicate that while multi-agent systems can enhance task success rates and productivity, they also introduce complexities and overhead in coordinating multiple specialized agents at scale. This suggests that overly granular decomposition may lead to diminishing returns, as the coordination overhead can offset the benefits of specialization.
Additionally, research on multi-agent reinforcement learning highlights that as the number of agents increases, managing interactions and ensuring well-coordinated activities becomes more complex, potentially impacting system performance (source:[AWS Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-multi-agent-collaboration-capability-for-amazon-bedrock/)and[ARXIV Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05007)).”
Of course, I’ve watched talks and read blog posts saying the same thing, but when you are down the rabbit hole late at night, sometimes it’s easy to forget the basics.
Since the charts were properly labeled, my agents were running around performing their tasks quicker, and my charts and markdown file were written to the same directory, I returned to getting the agents to write them to a directory that I specified. Recall that I mentioned that explicitly stating the output file path didn’t work, so, in a fit of desperation, I stated it as natural language:
> expected_output: &gt;
> Matplotlib charts should be saved in “reports” directory.
Unexpectedly, it worked, even though setting the explicit directory path with o*utput\_file*threw errors. CrewAI is full of surprises.
Last night, I tested a 1:2 relationship between agents and tasks by splitting up the tasks into 4 tasks. I now have a 1:2, 1:2 relationship. While this didn’t produce better results, it generated fewer errors when creating the data files and charts.
Here are the latest configurations for my agents in my crew:
```
@agent
def research\_agent(self) -&gt;&gt; Agent:
return Agent(
config=self.agents\_config[&#x27;&#x27;research\_agent&#x27;&#x27;],
llm=llm,
tools=[file\_writer\_tool, file\_read\_tool,directory\_read\_tool,serper\_tool,web\_search\_tool],
allow\_code\_execution=True,
allow\_delegation=True,
max\_execution\_time=300,
max\_retry\_limit=5
)
@agent
def reporting\_agent(self) -&gt;&gt; Agent:
return Agent(
config=self.agents\_config[&#x27;&#x27;reporting\_agent&#x27;&#x27;],
llm=llm,
tools=[file\_writer\_tool, file\_read\_tool,directory\_read\_tool],
allow\_code\_execution=True,
allow\_delegation=True,
max\_execution\_time=300,
max\_retry\_limit=5
)
```
If you are curious about my Agent and Task prompts and other configurations, you can find them in the[GitHub repo](https://github.com/stevielkim/REIAnalyst)for this project. If you want the results, you can view two versions of the generated reports at the end of this post.
## Summary
While it’s been fun experimenting, the results didn’t provide alternative insights to what I already knew about short-term rental trends. Also, the revenue and average daily rate aren’t accurate, but they aren’t so far off that I mind too much. None of this is too surprising, but with a few prompts in ChatGPT I got the same thing minus the data visualizations. So why use agents vs gpts? The autonomous parts, of course. Agents can interact with their environment in a way that gpts cannot. They can collaborate, delegate, and make decisions without explicit instructions as long as you put the right guardrails up to help them stay on task.
**Tips for Success**
* Test using fewer agents for potentially faster execution
* Balance explicit directives with flexibility
* For complex coding agents use max\_retry\_limit and max\_execution\_time for higher than the defaults
* Leverage Git to track changes
* Use the “planning” attribute, which helps control the task sequence
* Try using the hierarchical process as a manager (I haven’t yet, but plan to)
**Things to watch out for**
* Coding Agents make a ton of syntax errors, so set max\_retries higher than the default “2”
* You won’t always know if something goes wrong, so write the output to logs to help you debug
* Don’t fully rely on the CrewAI doc AI search functionality since it told me that memory is enabled by default, which is not accurate.
**Things I want to see**
* CrewAI auditing capabilities with built-in logging## Next Steps
Of course I saw a[CrewAI DeepLearning.AI](http://deeplearning.ai)course the day I finished writing this post, but that’s what I get for going straight to developer docs. I’m sure it shares what to do and not to do and would have saved me a lot of time with better results, so that’s what I’ll check out next. While I’m not convinced my particular use case is worthy of the environmental cost of iterating and running LLMs, it does provide an example of what agentic workflows can accomplish, especially for non-developers using low-code tools such as CrewAI.
What are your thoughts on use cases for agentic workflows? Any real-world use cases for problems that agents are uniquely poised to solve?
*If you’re hiring for product-related roles, I’d love to connect and discuss how I could contribute to your team!*
Here are two versions of the report with slight variations to the prompts (note the first version is not on GitHub, while the second version is).
